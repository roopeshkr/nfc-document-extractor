NFC-based verification leverages two things everybody has – IDs and smartphones. By tapping an NFC-enabled device against the ID, the RFID data within the NFC chip is extracted and verified. Using this in schools will help the school log library records, canteen records, even giving different access to students in different classes possible.

Everyday we try to makes lives easier for us. NFC does just that. It is very useful to
reduce time in various things in our day to day life. NFC-based verification leverages two
things everybody has – IDs and smartphones. By tapping an NFC-enabled device against
the ID, the RFID data within the NFC chip is extracted and verified (by cross-referencing
the information printed on the ID document). Not only is this faster and more efficient,
it can also help us detect frauds in real time. It can make marking attendance and
other systems requiring to keep logs quicker. Using this in schools will help the school
log library records, canteen records, even giving different access to students in different
classes possible.
Our motivation is to use some of these features in smaller extent to show its real
value in busy systems. This will also make knowledge of NFC and its applications more
widespread to people.
